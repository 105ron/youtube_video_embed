# YouTube Clone

This project is an introduction to including videos on HTML5 and using CSS to style a website like YouTube. This is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) HTML/CSS track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/embedding-images-and-video?ref=lc-pb) for more information. The goal of the project isn't to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page, but to focus on making the media elements show up. That means two things -- embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and showing little thumbnail images along the right side.
